# Mournmail Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how Shugo Maeda (the author of Mournmail) collects and uses information about users of Mournmail.

## Types of Information

"Personal Information" is information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, phone number, or email address. Except as described below, Shugo does not collect or require end-users of Mournmail to provide Personal Information.

"Non-Personal Information" is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. Non-Personal Information includes but is not limited to your computer’s configuration and the version of Mournmail you use.

"Potentially Personal Information" is information that is Non-Personal Information in and of itself but that could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify you. For example, Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”) (the addresses of web pages) or Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet), which are Non-Personal Information in and of themselves, could be Personal Information when combined with Internet service provider (“ISP”) records.

“Aggregate Data” is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.

## Information Collected by Mournmail

Mournmail is software, which allows users to integrate and manage their online communications, including email and other types of online messaging. Each Mournmail user chooses which online accounts he or she wishes to access using Mournmail.

When you set up Mournmail to access your email account, you will need to enter information and credentials for that account, such as your name, email address, and password. Mournmail stores this information on your computer.

In addition to your credentials, Mournmail needs certain Non-Personal, technical information from your account providers to configure each email account you use. This includes details about which servers to connect to and the protocols and settings that they use.

Mournmail stores other information on your computer, including information you enter in your Mournmail address book and copies of your email messages. Mournmail stores this information locally on your computer and does not transmit it to Shugo.

## Information Mournmail Sends to Email Providers and ISPs

Whenever you send or receive email, Mournmail attaches Non-Personal and Potentially Personal Information along with your request in the communication to your email provider and to email recipient(s). This may include, for example, your IP address. 
 
Like other messaging products, any information sent by Mournmail may be logged by your email provider and recipients, the internet service provider you are using, or any intermediary network between you and them. What information is logged and how that information is used depends on the policies of each of these different parties, and is outside Shugo's control. Each service provider determines its own privacy practices for the distribution and use of this Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information. If you are concerned about how a website or service provider will use this information, check out its privacy policy.

Whenever you send or receive email, that message is transmitted over the Internet through a connection that is unencrypted, an unscrupulous intermediary may be able to read or modify your messages. You can gain some additional measure of protection by only communicating with your email provider using an encrypted protocol, but this is not a complete protection.

## How to Contact Shugo about this Policy

You may request access, correction, or deletion of Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information, as permitted by law. We will seek to comply with such requests, provided that we have sufficient information to identify the Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information related to you.

Any such requests or other questions or concerns regarding this Policy and Shugo's data protection practices should be addressed to:
